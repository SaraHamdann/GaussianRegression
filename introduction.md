**Useful concepts to start with:**
------------------------------------
- **Predictor variables** = **independent** variables = **x**-variables = **input** variables = **Features** = **covariates**.
    - They explain changes in the response. 
    - You want to determine how changes in one or more predictors are associated with changes in the response.
    
    
- **Response variables** = **dependent** variables = **y**-variables = **outcome** variables. 
    - You want to determine whether changes in the predictors are associated with changes in the response.
    
    
- **Example:** A plant growth study: 
    - Predictors: are the amount of fertilizer applied, the soil moisture, and the amount of sunlight.
    - Response variable is the amount of growth that occurs during the study. 
    - Goal: to determine how changes in the predictors are associated with changes in plant growth (the response). 

------------------------------------
- **Variables**: the variables that you have in dataset (predictor variables & Response variables)

- **Observation:** = **data points**: the values of those features (variables)

- **Example:**

| X  | Y |
| -- | --- |
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  4  |
| 3  |  9  |
| 4  |  16 |
| 5  |  25 |

Here we have 2 features (variables): x and y ,
and 5 observations (data points): (1,1),(2,4),(3,9),(4,16),(5,25) 

------------------------------------

- **Regression** a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (Y) 
and one or more independent variables (X).
